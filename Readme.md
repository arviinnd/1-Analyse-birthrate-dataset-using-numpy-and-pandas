Dear Everyone <br>
Good morning! <br>

Subject: first repository <br> <br>
This is my first repository. We analyse and visualize the birthrate dataset using numpy, pandas and matplotlib. This is a dataset giving 
information on male and female births in the years 1969 to 2008 for different months. The mean, minimum and maximum births are 9762, 1 
and 199622 respectively. There is a steep increase in the number of births from year 1988 to year 1989.

Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely,    <br>
Narayanan Arvind    <br>
